abstract = {Prior research has found inconsistent effects of diversity on group performance. The present research identifies hormonal factors as a critical moderator of the diversity-performance connection. Integrating the diversity, status, and hormone literatures, we predicted that groups collectively low in testosterone, which orients individuals less toward status competitions and more toward cooperation, would excel with greater group diversity. In contrast, groups collectively high in testosterone, which is associated with a heightened status drive, would be derailed by diversity. Analysis of 74 randomly assigned groups engaged in a group decision-making exercise provided support for these hypotheses. The findings suggest that diversity is beneficial for performance, but only if group-level testosterone is low; diversity has a negative effect on performance if group-level testosterone is high. Too much collective testosterone maximizes the pains and minimizes the gains from diversity.},

abstract = "The dual-hormone hypothesis posits that testosterone's role in status-relevant behavior should depend on concentrations of cortisol, a hormone released in response to physical and psychological stress. This paper (i) reviews evidence for the dual-hormone hypothesis on measures of dominance, aggression, social status, risk-taking, and economic decision-making; (ii) discusses contextual and individual difference moderators of dual-hormone associations with behavior; and (iii) outlines key directions for future research. Together, this review points to promising support for the dual-hormone hypothesis across multiple behavioral domains relevant to the pursuit and maintenance of social status."

    abstract = { Abstract Work group diversity, the degree to which there are differences between group members, may affect group process and performance positively as well as negatively. Much is still unclear about the effects of diversity, however. We review the 1997–2005 literature on work group diversity to assess the state of the art and to identify key issues for future research. This review points to the need for more complex conceptualizations of diversity, as well as to the need for more empirical attention to the processes that are assumed to underlie the effects of diversity on group process and performance and to the contingency factors of these processes. }
