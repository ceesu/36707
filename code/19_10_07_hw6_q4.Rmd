# Weisberg, Applied Linear Regression, 34d ed., question 12.4 (pp. 267–268). In 12.4.1, your “test”
# can use a logistic regression model’s coefficients, or you can use a test you remember from
# another statistics class (such as a test for equality of proportions). In 12.4.5, write the paragraph
# as though you were writing a paragraph of the Conclusion section of a short report on the
# analysis.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
