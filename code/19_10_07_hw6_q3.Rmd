# Weisberg, Applied Linear Regression, 3rd ed., question 12.1 (pp. 266â€“267). You can obtain the
# data as the downer variable in the package alr3.
# You will have to remove cases for which observations are missing whenever you need those
# observations to fit a model.
# In 12.1.3, your comments should address what the two density plots (you can make those using
# ordinary kernel density smoothing) imply about how easy it would be to predict survival using
# this variable.
library(alr3)

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
